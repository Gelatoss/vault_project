# Vault Project

## Overview
A project where I built a mini vault system (software and hardware).

## Description
This project involved building a secure vault system using an Arduino microcontroller. The system features:
- A rotary encoder for setting and confirming the combination
- A servo motor to control the locking mechanism
- LEDs for visual feedback
- A buzzer for auditory alerts
- A 7-segment display for showing the current combination

Components like shift registers and a BCD decoder were used to manage the display. Both hardware and software components were thoroughly tested to ensure functionality and reliability, creating a safe storage solution for valuables.
